# AlMaRiMa team - Tablut AI Player


The aim of this project was to develop an AI agent that is able to play the game of Tablut according to the Ashton Rules.  

The final version of the player is intended to participate to the 2020-21 Tablut Competition between students of the Fundamentals of AI course held at the University of Bologna. 

The project is entirely java-based so, after having obtained the .jar file, here is how to run it:

```
java -jar AlMaRiMa.jar <black|white> <timeout-in-seconds> <server-ip>
```
